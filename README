# Password CLI - Written in Golang

This is a password CLI- for those tired of creating new passwords everytime. What if you had one (or a bunch) of masterPasswords
and you simple would permute them for different websites.

Nothing is currently stored in anywhere, there will be development for exporting the generated password for a txt file later on. The masterpassword is only in your memory.

## Development Todo (For first stable release):

- [ ] Better CLI options (export to txt,csv)
- [ ] Limit on permutation items
- [ ] Unitary Test and Coverage Tests
- [ ] CI/CD for releases versioning
- [ ] More randomness to the process (better security)
- [ ] Option for 1 permutation only
- [x] Copy to clipboard
